basic_game_scripting
====================

A quick VB.NET project that highlights two different ways to add quick and dirty scripting to your game.

The gist is you have an entity in a game that is bouncing from edge to edge. By either hitting the tilde (~) key to bring up and input box to add a scripted command, or have a specific script in a set location, a dev (or user) can alter the game's properties without having to recompile!

This is just a proof of concept to help nudge folks along in the right direction.
